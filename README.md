# Jamstack Test: GitHub Repository Listing

## Objective
Spend no more than 2 hours to create a simple application using a React framework (e.g., Next.js, Gatsby, Remix ...) that fetches and displays GitHub repositories. Implement simple pagination to manage and display the data efficiently.

### Core Requirements
- **Fetch Data:** Utilize the GitHub API to fetch and display at least 30 repositories, showing 10 results at a time. Use the following endpoint: `https://api.github.com/orgs/github/repos?sort=name&per_page=10&page=1`.
- **Pagination:** Implement "Next" and "Previous" buttons or automatically load the next set of items as you scroll.
- **UI Styling:** Style the list to resemble the appearance of GitHub's pinned items or the repository list on their org overview page (https://github.com/github). Omit complex elements like graphs and precise icons for simplicity.

### Considerations
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible by considering semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling to manage and communicate issues gracefully.
- **Styling:** You may use custom CSS or any compatible library for responsive design.

### Submission Instructions
- Provide clear instructions for setting up and running the project.
- Email tech-tests@catchdesign.co.nz with:
  - A link to your repo OR
  - A zip file of your project including git config/metadata

Aim to focus on functionality, code clarity, and user experience within the allocated time frame.
